Twitter Front End
==================

The Friday Challenge at Maker's Academy for week 7 was to recreate the Twitter frontend:

Reimplement the Twitter.com feed page as close as possible to the real look and feel. You will need a Twitter account to do this task because you'll be inspecting the structure of the real Twitter feed to understand how it's done.

Goal 1. Make sure it looks good on the desktop. As a minimum you should have the header and the list of tweets.

Goal 2. Add JavaScript for infinite scrolling (using dummy data, no server-side at all), expanding the tweet input box on focus and, if you're feeling adventurous, a popup to add a new tweet.
